# Sitecore-TinyMCERTE
This is a Sitecore Control that uses the Tiny MCE Editor in place of the default one

If you are not installing the full Sitecore Package available at http://emanueleciriachi.net/tinymce-sitecore-usage-configuration/, the following instructions must be followed:


-download and install the "TinyMCE for Sitecore - Core Items-1.0.zip" package; this will install the required items in the Code database.

-copy to your web project the folder "\sitecore\shell\Controls\Lib\tinymce"

-copy to your web project the folder "\sitecore\shell\Controls\TinyMCE Editor"

-copy to your web project the folder "\App_Config\Include\TinyEditor.config"


and of course, deploy the TinyMCERTE.dll file.
