# Sitecore-TinyMCERTE
This is a Sitecore Control that uses the Tiny MCE Editor in place of the default one

If you are not using the full package, the following instructions must be followed:


-download and install the "TinyMCE for Sitecore - Core Items-1.0.zip" package; this will install the required items in the Code database.

-copy to your web project the folder "\sitecore\shell\Controls\Lib\tinymce"

-copy to your web project the folder "\sitecore\shell\Controls\TinyMCE Editor"

-copy to your web project the folder "\App_Config\Include\TinyEditor.config"


and of course, the TinyMCERTE.dll file.
